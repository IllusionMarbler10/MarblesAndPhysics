## What is this program about?
Marbles and physics is a physics simulation program/2d physics sandbox game made by [Marcos Perez (A.K.A. IllusionMarbler)](https://github.com/IllusionMarbler10)
it's written using Python, with the libraries [Pygame(pygame-ce)](https://github.com/pygame-community/pygame-ce) , [Pygame_gui](https://github.com/MyreMylar/pygame_gui) and [Pymunk](https://github.com/viblo/pymunk).  

this project was started using only AI-generated code. (cause he tought that Marcos was going to do it himself, but now it's a time-saver for him.)  

in this program/game you can create objects, mechanisms, electricity (if that's possible yet!) and even Marble Races and Algothlons!
